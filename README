See card.js for assumptions i made.

I did not implment a full deck object, instead outlined my architecture in the assumptions of a workable deck. Was not sure if a full deck was needed to be implmented.

The tests will show how they are intended to be used.

The included tests are simply testing the units at work as they should. So these functions should be fairly adaptable to any card object, hence reducing coupiling.

To run the tests open index.html the libraries are included as external resources, so the machine will need internet access.


I had originally started down with the first test, and was going to use backbone, but it would have required me to spin up a server to get around the way you guys do authentication with basic auth, which does not play nice with jsonp (at least as far as i could gather from your docs and a cursory glance over the php implmentation of a client). To request an external resource with out cors, it requires jsonp which allows no control over the header. Just something for you to keep in mind developing rest apis.
